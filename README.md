# Star-Trek-Plex-Playlist-Maker

Star Trek canon in chronological order

Updated through season 1 of Star Trek: Prodigy 

Just two files needed, maker.ps1, Star-Trek-Plex-Playlist-Maker.csv.  EDIT where told to inside maker.ps1.  The script downloads the covers from github you don't need to download them.
