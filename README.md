# Star-Trek-Plex-Playlist-Maker

Updated through season 1 of Star Trek: Prodigy 

Just three files needed, maker.ps1, startrek-cron-complete-liveaction.csv, & startrek-cron-complete.csv.  EDIT where told to inside maker.ps1.  The script downloads the covers from github you don't need to download them.

Stole a lot from https://github.com/robinmalik/PSPlex to make this work
